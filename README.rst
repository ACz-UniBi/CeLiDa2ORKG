Cephalopoden Literature Database to Open Research Knowledge Graph
=================================================================
(acronym CeLiDa2ORKG)

Back in 2005, the Cephalopoden Literature Database, shortly CeLiDa, was developed at Institut f√ºr Meereskunde, Kiel.
The project was introduced by `Uwe Piatkowski <https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1558-5817>`_, developed by `Andreas Czerniak <https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3883-4169>`_ and supported by different HiWi's.

The CeLiDa use `RefBase <http://www.refbase.net>`_ as the fundamental Literature Database. RefBase was developed back to 2004.
RefBase, the Literatue Database, was enhanced with the functionality to relate dedicated nodes. Nodes could be like
Species with a numbers and a unit, to publications.

As a result, CeLiDa could answer the questions:

- in which publications do the Specy xy appear?
- in which publications do the femal specy xy appear?
- in which publications do the specy xy , only male, with size ab.

CeLiDa instance was latest executed at Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research, Kiel, GEOMAR.
Maintained by Data Management and Computer Center.
