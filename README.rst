Cephalopoden Literature Database to Open Research Knowledge Graph
=================================================================
(acronym CeLiDa2ORKG)

Back in 2005, the Cephalopoden Literature Database, shortly CeLiDa, was developed at
*Institut für Meereskunde*, Kiel.
The project was introduced by `Uwe Piatkowski <https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1558-5817>`_ from Marine Evolutionsökologie.
Architect, design, and development of the search has been done by `Andreas Czerniak <https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3883-4169>`_ and supported by different HiWi's.

The CeLiDa use `RefBase <http://www.refbase.net>`_ as the fundamental Literature Database. RefBase was developed back to 2004.
RefBase, the Literatue Database, was enhanced with the functionality to relate dedicated nodes. Nodes could be like
Species with a numbers and a unit, to publications.

As a result, CeLiDa could answer the questions:

- in which publications do the Specy xy appear?
- in which publications do the femal specy xy appear?
- in which publications do the specy xy , only male, with size ab.

CeLiDa instance was latest executed at Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research, Kiel, `GEOMAR <https://www.geomar.de>`_.
Maintained by Data Management and Computer Center.

The upcoming todo's

- get in touch with Uwe
- get in touch with Data Management group and Compute Center at GEOMAR which operates the latest CeLiDa instance (dm-celida.geomar.de).
- set up a local instance of ORKG
- ETL

  - identify the needed attributes
  - exploring a way to extract these attributes and relations
  - converting to fit the ORKG import format
  - load the format into the local instance
  - check results
  - re-export/converting if needed
  - load to official ORKG
  - check results
  - re-export/converting if needed

- inform Uwe on results
